# Text Encryption Tool
A simple text encryption tool coded in Python.  
The user can choose to encrypt or decrypt their phrase using the Caesar or Vigenere method.
Based on the method they choose, the user will be prompted to enter certain values or phrases to enable the encryption/decryption method to work successfully. 
For both methods, special characters are ignored and left as is.

## Caesar Cipher
If the user chooses the Caesar method, they will be prompted to enter the amount of characters to shift each letter. This value can be negative.

## Vigenere Cipher
If the user chooses the Vigenere method, they will be prompted to choose a keyword to pair up with their text phrase and create a matrix. The word can be as long as the user wants.
